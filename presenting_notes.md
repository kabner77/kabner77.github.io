# Data Viz Presentation

https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kabner77/kabner77.github.io/master?filepath=Abner_Kayla_Final_Part3.ipynb

have up: mybinder, datasets

## 1 minute - dataset, story, and process for final article

* dataset - both datasets derivatives of ODM project
  * WineSpectator, CellarTracker
* wanted to tell a story about wine words, but that will be with final dataset, not these intermediate ones.
  * how has use of words changed over time? 
  * demo 
* process: used my viz from part 2, and created two other vizzes. still related to wine and is interesting per the data source, but is a different data source. the purpose of the other two = mostly just to make ppl think critically about what data vizzes show. 

## 1 minute - discoveries about datasets

* words that i thought were very common aren't really (youthful seen a few times, but small in the actual dataset)
* experimented with cost by year plots and score by year b/c numbers, but weren't particularly interesting (up and down continually)
* more interested in words, which is the spirit of this project too
* licenses: per other prof: not allowed to share the data on its own, though it is web scraped. in aggregate i think is okay, like in this viz. 

## 1 minute - next steps

* first, Jill's suggestion to have a summary plot with a few common words, as a follow up to the interactive one, to show some interesting trends.
* second, hide the code! (pls tell me if you've figured that out, i saw a thing about tags but idk where to put them)
* last (probably not in this iteration), do more work on the dataset to line up tasting notes b/t WS and CT. plot = frequency of words over time b/t WS and CT (critic and amateur). similar to current viz but w/ two lines.

## 1 minute - thank you! questions??
