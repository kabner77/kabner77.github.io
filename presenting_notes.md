## 1 minute - dataset, story, and process for final article

* dataset - both datasets derivs of ODM project
  * WineSpectator, CellarTracker
* wanted to tell a story about wine words, but that will be with final dataset, not these intermediate ones.
  * how has use of them changed over time? 
* process: used my viz from part 2, and created two other vizzes. the purpose of the other two = mostly just to make ppl think critically about what data vizzes show.

## 1 minute - discoveries about datasets

* words that i thought were very common aren't really.
* experimented with cost by year plots, but weren't particulalry interesting (up and down continually)
* more interested in words, which is the spirit of this project too
* licenses: probably not allowed to share the data on its own, though it is web scraped. in aggregate i think is okay, like in this viz. 

## 1 minute - next steps

* first, Jill's suggestion to have a summary plot with a few common words, as a follow up to the interactive one. 
* second, hide the code! (pls tell me if you've figured that out, i saw a thing about tags but idk where to put them)
* last (probably not in this iteration), do more work on the dataset to line up tasting notes b/t WS and CT. plot = frequency of words over time b/t WS and CT (critic and amateur)

## 1 minute - thank you! questions??
